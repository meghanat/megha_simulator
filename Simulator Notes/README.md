# FAQ

### Q1. What is the difference between the `ref_megha_sim.py` and `megha_sim.py`?
The file `ref_megha_sim.py` is the version of the simulator code on which the code notes are based on. More specifically the note points, doubts, line numbers and other code-specific terms used in the notes are with reference to the file `ref_megha_sim.py`.

`ref_megha_sim.py` **will not be updated** and is only for **reference purposes** with the code notes. The **latest** and **most updated version** of the simulator is `megha_sim.py`.
