# FAQ

### Q1. What is the difference between the `./ref_megha_sim.py` and the `../src/megha_sim/` module?
The file `ref_megha_sim.py` is the version of the simulator code on which the code notes are based on. More specifically the note points, doubts, line numbers and other code-specific terms used in the notes are with reference to the file `ref_megha_sim.py`.

`ref_megha_sim.py` **will not be updated** and is only for **reference purposes** with the code notes. The **latest** and **most updated version** of the simulator is `../src/megha_sim/`.

The file `../src/runner.py` is used to run the simulator with a given configuration and input trace dataset.
