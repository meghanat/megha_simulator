90 - insert to the end

102 - it is accessing the first job in the queue. Make it access the last one

126 - if it is fully scheduled, something is happening
I think what's happening is that while iterating over the tasks of a job, you assign a task somewhere and then check again if the job has been fully_scheduled. If it has, then you can remove it from the job_queue.
Need to change it to end of queue

165 - remove the end

182 - same as 126
Need to pop from end of queue

205 - appending job to end of queue. Probably don't have to change anything here
